# Spotify Analysis

This project analyzes Spotify listening history data using Power BI.

## Files

- `spotify_history.csv.xlsx`: Raw Spotify listening history data.
- `Spotify Analysis.pdf`: Power BI report with visualizations and insights.
- `Spotify Data Explaination.pdf`: Documentation explaining the data fields.

> **Note:** The original Power BI project file (`.pbix`) could not be uploaded due to admin restrictions.

## Getting Started

1. Open the Power BI report ([Spotify Analysis.pdf](Spotify%20Analysis.pdf)) to view the analysis.
2. Refer to [Spotify Data Explaination.pdf](Spotify%20Data%20Explaination.pdf) for details about the data columns.
3. Use the raw data file ([spotify_history.csv.xlsx](spotify_history.csv.xlsx)) for your own analysis or to update the Power BI report.

## Project Goal

To gain insights into Spotify listening habits using data visualization and analysis tools.

## Project Overview

Developed an advanced, interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify user listening behavior across platforms, time periods, and albums. This end-to-end project focused on building dynamic reports using real-world music consumption data from 2015 to 2024.

### Key Contributions

**Data Modeling & DAX Measures:**

- Engineered custom DAX calculations (CALCULATE, COUNTROWS, DISTINCT, etc.) to compute KPIs such as total albums played, YoY growth, and frequency distribution.
- Implemented time intelligence metrics to compare trends between latest and previous years.

**Interactive Visualizations:**

- Created engaging charts: area charts (listening trends), donut charts (weekday vs. weekend listening), bar charts (top albums), heat maps (hourly & weekly patterns), and scatter plots (quadrant analysis for track engagement).
- Applied drill-down and drill-through functionality to allow multi-layered data exploration for albums, tracks, and platforms.

**Dynamic Dashboard Features:**

- Integrated slicers and filters to enable real-time user interaction (by year, album, or platform).
- Designed conditional formatting logic for quadrant-based scatter plots, improving visual interpretation of engagement patterns.

**User Experience & Aesthetics:**

- Applied custom color codes, titles, tooltips, and labels to enhance dashboard readability and storytelling.
- Structured a clean UI to support decision-making and pattern recognition in music consumption data.

### Outcome

Delivered a fully functional analytics solution capable of identifying top albums, peak listening times, and user behavior segmentation. Strengthened expertise in data storytelling, visual analytics, and Power BI dashboard development.
